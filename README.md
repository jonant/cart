## The Task

You are implementing a simple checkout system, there are four products available, each with a price per unit. Some products have a special price when bought in certain quantities (e.g. 3 of product A costs 140, not 150). Implement a checkout system that allows items to be “scanned” via their Item Code, and returns the sub total when queried. 

Make sure your solution includes everything that it would in a production environment, i.e. verifying results, documentation.

Please provide your solution in a git repo. e.g. github, bitbucket, etc. 

## Dataset

| Item Code | Unit Price | Special Price |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
|     A	    |      50    |    3 for 140  |
|     B     |      35    |    2 for 60   |
|     C     |      25    |               |
|     D     |      12    |               |
